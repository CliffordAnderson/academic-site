title: "Teaching BJC with NetsBlox: A Case Study from Vanderbilt University"
abstract: In this short talk, we present a case study of how faculty at
  Vanderbilt University adapted The Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum into
  an introductory computing course for non-majors and potential majors at the
  School of Engineering. We share how the spirit and principles of the BJC [1]
  guided the development of the course even as we diverged significantly from
  aspects of the curriculum.

In this short talk, we present a case study of how faculty at Vanderbilt University adapted The Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum into an introductory computing course for non-majors and potential majors at the School of Engineering. We share how the spirit and principles of the BJC \[1] guided the development of the course even as we diverged significantly from aspects of the curriculum.

Among the primary differences were the use of NetsBlox rather than Snap! as the computing environment \[2]. Given the support in NetsBlox for remote procedure calls as well as distributed programming, we discuss changes to classroom exercises and summative student projects. We also share why we shifted textbooks from the venerable Blown to Bits! \[3] to more recent works by Claire Evans \[4] and Martin Erwig \[5].

We conclude by sharing our own experiences teaching the course as digital humanist and educational technologist rather than as computer scientists and by expressing recommendations about teaching courses in computational thinking to undergraduate students of the humanities and social sciences.
